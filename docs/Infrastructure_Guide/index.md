# 1. Overview

This section serves as a knowledge base for the projectâ€™s backend infrastructure. It was created for a few purposes:

1.	To document how I built everything, so I can easily reference it later.
2.	To help others learn how to build something similar.
3.	To provide a clear understanding of how all the components work together.

This infrastructure guide will be constantly updated as changes or updates to resources occur.

The infrastructure is mainly in support of TCG data since there are multiple data sources that are being used to support the CLI/TUI.
The VGC data simply calls one API.

!!! warning

    All of the commands ran for this project in the terminal are based on macOS (i.e., Homebrew to install packages). 
    If building on a different operating system, please find the equivalent command. Links will be provided for install 
    guides for all operating systems when possible.

Below is a list of all the tools and services used in this project's infrastructure:

- AWS

    - S3
    - VPC
    - EC2
- Dagster

- Terraform

!!! note

    Keep in mind that the purpose of this project is to explore and learn new tools, services, and programming languages.
    Some design choices might be overkill or not make much sense at all, but included purely for learning.
